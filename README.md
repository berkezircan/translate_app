## What libraries i used ?
1. <b><a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a></b>:  A modern JavaScript utility library delivering.<br> Why i used it ? Because when i tried the translate something on input. It translates one by one each letter.
Lodash provides that i can use debounce. When i finish my writing on input, action get fired and it queries the translation word.modularity, performance & extras.
2. <b><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass">Node-sass</a></b> : I used for SASS styling.
3.  <b><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/translate">Translate:</a></b> : Convert text to different languages on Node.js and the browser. Flexible package and powerful back-end using Google (default), [Yandex](https://translate.yandex.com/), [Libre](https://libretranslate.com/) or [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator):
4. Also i used open source <a href="https://codepen.io/ochi/pen/apgxBd">design</a>. I converted this design to react application.
